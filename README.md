# f.Sentence

**f.Sentence** isn't just another text editor — it's the beginning of a new way to write.

Crafted with **Flutter** and designed around **Material You**,  
f.Sentence is being built to rethink how text processing should feel in the modern age —  
across **Android**, **Windows**, and beyond.

It's fast.  
It's minimal.  
It's powerful.  
And it's only the beginning.

## Vision

In a world flooded with bloated software and forgotten design,  
f.Sentence is a return to clarity —  
a tool that respects your thoughts, your time, and your creativity.

This is not a clone.  
This is not a shortcut.  
This is a **statement** — of what software *can be*.

Part of the **Flake** vision.  
Built not to follow trends — but to **set** them.
