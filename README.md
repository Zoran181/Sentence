# f.Sentence
**f.Sentence** is a lightweight, modern text processor built with Flutter and designed to be beautiful, fast, and privacy-friendly. Inspired by Material You, it brings elegance and simplicity to everyday writing.

This is an early-stage open source project. Features and UI are still evolving, but the vision is clear: to rethink how we interact with text on Android and Windows.

## Project Status
Coming soon! Initial prototypes and design drafts are underway.
