**f.Sentence** isn't just another text editor — it's the beginning of a new way to write.

Crafted with **Flutter** and designed around **Material You**,  
f.Sentence is being built to rethink how text processing should feel in the modern age —  
across **Android**, **Windows**, and beyond.

It's fast.  
It's minimal.  
It's powerful.  
And it's only the beginning.

## Status

**Coming soon.**  
This project is in early development. Updates will follow.

## Vision

In a world flooded with bloated software and forgotten design,  
f.Sentence is a return to clarity —  
a tool that respects your thoughts, your time, and your creativity.
